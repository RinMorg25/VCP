            <p class="tmp"> Personal and Working History:   I was born in Manchester in 1938 but I have lived in Bolton for the past 50 years. When I left school I went into engineering but then had to go and do my National Service and ended up a Medic. After my forces service I continued to work in hospitals and qualified as a State Registered Nurse and also a Registered Psychiatric nurse. I retired at 55 as I senior nurse administrator.
            <br>
            <br> I have always loved the countryside and led a very active life I was a member of a Mountain Rescue team for over 20 years, climbed and potholed and also enjoyed running marathons in my 40’s.  Which now in my 70’s is the reason for my decrepitude! After I retired, along with my late wife, we sold homemade cards and woodcraft at craft shows all over the north west of England
            <br>
            <br> I started writing poetry many years ago but it was always for my own amusement and I did not show it to anybody except my wife. During the past few years I have had poems published in magazines and booklets and have been encouraged by my family and some friends to publish a book to enable them to reach a wider audience.
